MailingLists
============

Mailing lists are an important part of the infrastructure of development of Web standards - generally PostMan is the standard, but it is maintained by a single individual and the interface/features could use some updating.  

This repo is intended to help us improve the situation.

Missing/Helpful Feature Ideas
========================
First step would be to collect some "wants" or requirements for a better experience... Given this we can solicit potential designs.
* Ability to follow a conversation given a link more easily - view this thread, for example.  Seems standard to have "view contemporary threads" but no way to focus.  
* Archive thread links often dont seem to cross archive groups (months, for example)
* Tagging feature would be helpful for posterity
* A way to subscribe to a topic (or filter what comes to email), not just a list.
* Should probably be "brandable" so that as a maintainer you can fairly easily theme it up and for users so you can easily know what list you are dealing with
* Offline viewing of recently viewed archives would be helpful
